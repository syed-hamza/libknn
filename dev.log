- Brute-force algorithm with only compiler optimizations is 
  17x slower the scikit-learn KNN with brute-force algorithm 

- Optimizations:
    - use openBLAS/Eigen libraries for euclidean distance


23/02/2025
- Reduced function calls in the prediction function with 
  STL functions and nested loops

- Brought slowness down to only ~8.1%

25/02/2025
- Used STL function inner_product to speed up eulcidean distance calculation calculation
- Used max heap based nearest neighbour querying

- Current slowness reduction: ~7.1%

26/02/2025
- Added simple heuristic optimizations to remove redundant calculations

- Current slowness reduction: ~5.0%
